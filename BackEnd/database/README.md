### Purpose

The purpose of the `DbModels` folder is to provide a centralized location for all the data models used in the application. This makes it easier to manage and maintain them.

### Contents

The `DbModels` folder may contain various files, each representing a different data model. These files define the properties, relationships, and validation rules for the corresponding data entity.

### Usage

### Guidelines

When creating or modifying models, follow these best practices:

- Use descriptive and meaningful names for the models.
- Define clear and concise properties that accurately represent the data.
- Consider adding validation rules to ensure data integrity.
- Document the purpose and usage of each model within its file.
