# Models

The Models folder contains the data models used in the application. These models represent the structure and behavior of the data entities within the system.

## Purpose

The purpose of the Models folder is to centralize and organize the data models used throughout the application. By keeping all the models in one place, it becomes easier to manage and maintain them.

## Contents

The Models folder may contain various files, each representing a different data model. These files typically define the properties, relationships, and validation rules for the corresponding data entity.

## Usage

To use a model, simply import it into the relevant module or file where it is needed. Once imported, you can create instances of the model, set its properties, and perform operations on the data.

## Guidelines

When creating new models or modifying existing ones, it is important to follow certain guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability. Here are some best practices to consider:

- Use descriptive and meaningful names for the models.
- Define clear and concise properties that accurately represent the data.
- Consider adding validation rules to ensure data integrity.
- Document the purpose and usage of each model within its file.
